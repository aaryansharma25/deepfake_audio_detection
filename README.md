Deepfake Audio Detection
This project aims to detect audio deepfakes by analyzing audio recordings and determining their authenticity. Utilizing a machine learning model trained on Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs) extracted from audio samples, the system classifies recordings as either 'real' or 'fake'.
